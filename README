== Welcome to ActiveMerchant Adyen Demo App

This app is intended to show how an application using adyen as payment provider could look like.
It has cucumber tests for the whole workflow  ;)


You need to be running a server with the app at port 8080 (adyen can only talk to a limited number of ports). See features + steps.
Remember to set up adyen correctly and make sure the "Result URL for Test" page of adyen is pointing to your server  

Also install the adyen active merchant fork from here as a plugin:
	script/plugin install http://github.com/Vilango/active_merchant
